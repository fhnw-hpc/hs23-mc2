### Mini Challenge 2

In this Mini Challenge 2, we will be programming, parallelizing, accelerating, and analyzing the compression-decompression of Alzheimer's MRI images. The first part (CPU) can be worked on locally on your own PC or on [FHNW Jupyter Hub](https://jhub.cs.technik.fhnw.ch/). The second part requires an Nvidia GPU. You can also develop on a private GPU or use the free service provided by [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com/).

[Use GitHub Classroom to work on this mini challenge](https://classroom.github.com/a/nLN_c1Qr)

### Remarks
* The Mini Challenge is divided into 2 parts:
  * Part 1: Optimize CPU implementation
  * Part 2: Create and optimize GPU implementation
* In tasks 1-5, you will learn various concepts of parallelization and acceleration in Python applied to individual images.
* In task 6, you can apply the learned concepts to multiple images at your discretion.
* Task 7 corresponds to the interpretation and reflection of the Mini Challenge.


### Special Bonus
* A new programming language called Mojo was released a few weeks ago.
* There is an additional grade bonus for those who use Mojo in this Mini Challenge and incorporate it into all measurements/comparisons.
* Docs: [Mojo Documentation](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)
